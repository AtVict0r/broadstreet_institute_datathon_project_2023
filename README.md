# Pregnancy-Related Mortality Data Analysis

## Overview

This repository showcases my solo implementation of the Pregnancy-Related Mortality Data Analysis project, which I completed after participating in the Datathon organized by the BroadStreet Institute. During the Datathon, I had the opportunity to collaborate with my teammates Nadia Malik, Shriya Kalakata, and Thembi Ndebele, and I would like to express my gratitude to them for their valuable contributions and teamwork.

I thoroughly enjoyed the Datathon experience, where I had the chance to enhance my data analysis skills and contribute to community health assessment projects. The insights gained and the knowledge acquired were immensely valuable, allowing me to refine my data-driven decision-making abilities.

## Contents

The repository contains the following materials:

1. **[dataset.csv](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-F0vjCpBiD_76nwZEekZ3874dv3O-L3wF0nNX5gYTdc/edit?usp=sharing)**: This CSV file includes the indicator list and data for pregnancy-related mortality across all states. The indicator list is based on the instructions provided by the BroadStreet Institute.
2. **infographs/**: This directory holds individual PNG infograph files, each representing pregnancy-related mortality data for a specific state. The template for the infographs was adapted from a Canvas project shared by the BroadStreet Institute during the Datathon.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to extend my gratitude to the BroadStreet Institute ([GitHub](https://github.com/BroadStreet-Health), [Website](https://www.broadstreet.org/)) for organizing the Datathon and providing the materials and instructions required to conduct this analysis. Their efforts in promoting data-driven community health assessments are commendable and have greatly contributed to my learning journey.
